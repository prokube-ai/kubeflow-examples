# Minimal container components
This example shows a minimal example of how to use 
[container components](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/components/container-components/)
in pipelines.  

The pipeline itself is in `pipeline.py` and you can use `submit-cluster.py` or `submit-remote.py` to submit from
the cluster or remotely, respectively.
